# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

This game is developed by me as part of my foundation course projects on the Odin projects.

it is a game between a user and a computer

## Instructions

when lauched(using the playgame button), the user is expected to click on one of the icons under the "pick your choice" heading, to pick their choice, each icon represent rock, paper and scissors respectively.

the Game continues until either the user or the computer attains a score of 5(and emmerges the winner).

suggestions and criticism are welcomed.

NOTE: Paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper.
